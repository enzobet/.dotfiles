#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 5000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

scrollback_pager_history_size 500

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximately
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

#: Mouse {{{

mouse_hide_wait 1.0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is Cocoa is too
#: much effort.

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

#: Window layout {{{


enabled_layouts horizontal,vertical,stack

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

#: Tab bar {{{

tab_bar_edge top

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

# tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

tab_bar_style powerline

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create
#:     a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of
#:     tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_min_tabs 1

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

tab_powerline_style slanted

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

# tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

# tab_title_template "{fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. All data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     The current tab title.
#: index
#:     The tab index usable with goto_tab N goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     The current layout name.
#: num_windows
#:     The number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     The number of window groups (a window group is a window and all of its overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     The working directory of the currently active window in the tab
#:     (expensive, requires syscall). Use active_oldest_wd to get
#:     the directory of the oldest foreground process rather than the newest.
#: tab.active_exe
#:     The name of the executable running in the foreground of the currently
#:     active window in the tab (expensive, requires syscall). Use
#:     active_oldest_exe for the oldest foreground process.
#: max_title_length
#:     The maximum title length available.

#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

#: Color scheme {{{

include themes/onedark.conf

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

# background_opacity 1.0

background_opacity 0.95

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. When using a low value for this
#: setting, it is desirable that you set the background color to a
#: color the matches the general color of the desktop background, for
#: best text rendering.  If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

background_blur 15

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE under X11.

#: Advanced {{{

editor nvim

#: The terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($SHELL -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

clipboard_max_size 0

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.
